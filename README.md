- 👋 Hi, I’m @beardwhiskers
- 👀 I’m interested in GSI ROM upgrades of my 2 old smartphones (Blu Vivo XL4 and Nokia Lumia 521).  For my Blu Vivo XL4, I just tested several AOSP GSI ROMs by PHHusson and successfully upgraded to PHH AOSP 10.0 v.222.  I created a detailed summary on the XDA Forum (https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/upgraded-my-blu-vivo-xl4-with-custom-gsi-roms-from-phhusson.4605119/).  For my Nokia Lumia 521, I installed LineageOS 14.1 successfully and documented that on the XDA Forum (https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/android4lumia-android-for-lumia-52x-620-and-720.3985347/page-4#post-88692637).  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ways to further modify my Blu Vivo XL4.  Since it is fully rooted with SuperSU, I created and successfully installed a "bootanimation.zip" file.  I haven't succeeded yet in getting a "bootaudio.mp3" to play during bootup, but that's the current focus...  
- 💞️ I’m not a software programmer.  So, I'm not currently looking to collaborate on a software development project.  I created this account mainly to be able to make a financial contribution to PHHusson for his very helpful AOSP GSI ROMs that I tested recently...
